# simple-go-fileserver
 Replacement for python SimpleHTTPServer in golang
 
 As a convert from python, for the longest time I was still using `python -m SimpleHTTPServer <port>` 
 Whenever I wanted to spin up a browser to view some static content or let someone download some files from my machine.
 Knowing full well it's limitations and having done go for a while now, recently started writing the same barebones main file.
 Publishing it in case others find it useful
